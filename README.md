# Dynamic Form

This is a small app to render a form from a JSON configuration.
An example configuration can be seen and edited in `src/form-configuration.json`

## Tech

⚛ [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the UI

💅 [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for the styling

🎣 [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) form the form logic

🧪 [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) for the tests

🧶 [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for the package managing and running

## Running

To run the app simply `yarn` then `yarn start`

## Tests

To run the tests `yarn` then `yarn test`

The tests don't pass when viewing this project in Codesandbox but pass absolutely fine when running locally. No clue why 🤷‍♀️
